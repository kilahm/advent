1. multiply two large numbers, put in address 63
1. Write (value in address 63 is less than number from step 1) to address 63
1. if value in address 63 is true, jump to 53
1. multiply 3 * 1, write to address 1000 (outside of program bounds)
1. move memory pointer +988 by value
1. move memory pointer +3 by relative
1. move memory pointer +3 by address
1. move memory pointer +3 by relative
1. move memory pointer +3 by relative
1. put input into memory 0 by relative (which points at 1000)
1. 



* output 1102 indicates no support for large numbers
